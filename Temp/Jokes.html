    <h1> Jokes </h1>
    <h4> They are healthy for our mentality. Imagine living a life with no jokes, or even amazing puns. How could anyone ever live like that?! When would you ever laugh if you had no jokes? You would never be able to lighten up the mood or hear poeple laugh. Jokes are a necessity to life. </h4>
